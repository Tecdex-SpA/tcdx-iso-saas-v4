The reviewed authority is `iso_controls` plus same-version `iso_evidence_expectations` from this export. Coverage means faithful materialization of the approved product reference snapshot, whose source_policy is copyright_safe_summary; it does not assert reproduction of the full normative publications.

ISO9001:2026_FDIS is transition preparation only. It has no `product_standard_code`, no row in the selectable `standards` compatibility catalog and no projection into `controls_catalog`. It does not replace ISO9001:2015 and must not be sold or represented as final/certifiable ISO9001:2026. Absence of a final 2026 catalog is not a blocker for this review gate. Historical ISO27701/27017/27018 compatibility is preserved and outside current blockers.
